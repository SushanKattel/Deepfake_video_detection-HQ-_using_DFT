# Deepfake_video_detection-HQ-_using_DFT
In 2014, Goodfellow et al. introduced an adversarial framework (GAN) which marked a milestone in generative models which significantly improved Image Generation, leading to a striking progress on artificial faces among others. As a consequence, new image and video
manipulation techniques known as DeepFake have emerged
and established themselves online over the last few months, probably year.
This occurrence of events on digital image forensics has been
drawing an ever increasing attention trying to detect GAN
generated images or videos which is much harder for human eyes.

Here, we have created a model feeding 20K fake faces from ThisPersonDoesNotExist and 100K fake dataset and 20K original faces from FlickerImages and CelebA-HQ dataset using the features by Frequency domain analyzed on a space defined by Fourier transform and classified by SVM (Non linear classification algorithm) {and also, Linear Regression} in reference to a paper by Janis Keuper et.al., which is providing about 99% accuracy on classifying HIGH RESOLUTION DEEPFAKE and ORIGINAL videos.
